    info: "Romania’s chemical industry underwent a significant transformation following the collapse of communist rule. Initially, the sector focused on high-volume, low-complexity exports. However, after 2000, this strategy shifted, with branches like automotive chemicals, rubber production, and plastic packaging emerging as key export drivers. Simultaneously, many other sectors remained reliant on imports. This installation presents this shift through a digital layer and  coupling it with a collection of 39 metallic tiles. ",
