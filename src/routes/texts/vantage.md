Vantage is a web-based software for spatial reconstruction of photos and videos.  
It enables the production of visual evidence through perspectival reconstruction of images and their projection onto 3D models of terrain and buildings.  
Reconstructions can be exported as videos or interactive visualizations, supporting visual storytelling in investigative journalism.

For investigative journalists and fact-checkers, images and videos sourced from social media often represent a crucial working material â€” and, in conflict areas, sometimes the only available source.  

Yet this persuasive visual material demands rigorous verification: do the time and place of the footage correspond to the claimed event? What is actually visible in the images? How do clips from different angles relate to each other?

Only a few investigations go beyond geolocation (the precise determination of where the footage was recorded). However, projects such as _The Seizure of the Iuventa (Forensic Architecture, 2018)_ have demonstrated the journalistic potential of spatial reconstruction.  

Until now, though, creating such reconstructions has been highly demanding, requiring advanced skills in specialist software (GIS, 3D modeling, video editing) and offering little opportunity for collaboration.

Vantage supports this laborious but essential process by bringing all operational phases together in a unified, accessible web interface. 

The tool is designed for small investigative teams who previously lacked the resources or technical expertise to carry out complex spatial reconstructions.
