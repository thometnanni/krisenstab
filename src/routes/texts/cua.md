We are currently developing a new version of the China Unofficial Archives, a digital repository dedicated to preserving and making accessible key documents, films, blogs, and publications created by independent thinkers, writers, and activists in China. The project traces the efforts of individuals and communities who have worked to document and reinterpret the country’s recent history outside official channels, often at significant personal risk.

By gathering and organizing these materials, the China Unofficial Archives seeks to create an open and enduring resource for researchers, educators, and the public. Its goal is to ensure that these independent voices and records remain available for future generations and continue to inform a more nuanced understanding of contemporary Chinese history.
