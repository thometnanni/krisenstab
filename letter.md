we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.

We are back from a weekend at [Indiecon](https://www.indiecon-festival.com) and pretty much finalised our exhibit for [Design Signals â€“ Chemical Bonds](https://faber.ro/eveniment/design-signals-expozitia-legaturi-chimice/) opening September 26 in Timisoara. We're also trying substack now, [subscribe for studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com).

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).

See ya, <br>
Fidel, Giacomo and Julian. <br>
