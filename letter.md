we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.


Last week our project [Vantage](/projects/vantage), has been featured on [Creative Applications](https://www.creativeapplications.net/news/vantage-reconstructs-the-spatial-context-of-video-recordings/).

Over the past month, we've been dealing with increased malicious bot activity, while [Design Signals – Chemical Bonds](/projects/design-signals) remains on view in Timișoara. 


<!-- If you’d like to keep up with our work, you can follow our [studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com) on Substack.  -->

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).   
Ciao!
