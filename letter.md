we are a design studio [working](/projects) at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.

We finalised our exhibit for [Design Signals – Chemical Bonds](https://faber.ro/eveniment/design-signals-expozitia-legaturi-chimice/) which opened on September 26 in Timișoara. Right now, we’re experimenting with dithering techniques for images and exploring the alphabetical sorting of Chinese characters.

You can follow some of our [studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com) on Substack, and we’re always glad to receive [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).

Ciao, <br>
Fidel, Giacomo and Julian. <br>
