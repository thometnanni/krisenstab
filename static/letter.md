we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.


Our latest project, [Design Signals – Chemical Bonds](https://faber.ro/eveniment/design-signals-expozitia-legaturi-chimice/) opened on September 26 in Timișoara. Right now, we’re exploring dithering effects on the web togheter with Chinese Samizdat layouts.

If you’d like to keep up with our work, you can follow our [studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com) on Substack. 

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).   
Ciao!
