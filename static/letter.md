we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.


Over the past month, we've been teaching _Creative Coding_ while our project [Design Signals – Chemical Bonds](https://faber.ro/eveniment/design-signals-expozitia-legaturi-chimice/) is on view in Timișoara. We're now exploring web-based dithering techniques and Chinese Samizdat layouts.

If you’d like to keep up with our work, you can follow our [studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com) on Substack. 

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).   
Ciao!
