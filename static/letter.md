we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.


We just published a new website for [China Unofficial Archives](https://minjian-danganguan.org/en), the non-profit digital archive for censored and suppressed Chinese history.

Last week we decided to document [more in progress work on are.na](https://www.are.na/krisenstab/krisenstab-tq2jbe7qrkk), then we went for [Mohnnudeln](https://www.are.na/block/41811512).

<!-- If you’d like to keep up with our work, you can follow our [studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com) on Substack.  -->

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).   
Ciao!
