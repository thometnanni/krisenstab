we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.


In the past month we've been teaching _Creative Coding_ while our project [Design Signals – Chemical Bonds](https://faber.ro/eveniment/design-signals-expozitia-legaturi-chimice/) is exhibited in Timișoara.  Right now, we’re exploring dithering effects on the web togheter with Chinese Samizdat layouts.

If you’d like to keep up with our work, you can follow our [studio updates](https://krisenstab.substack.com) on Substack. 

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).   
Ciao!
<!-- Fidel, Giacomo and Julian. <br> -->
