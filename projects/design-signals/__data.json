Using international trade data from 1960 onward, each sectoris represented on a scatter plot graph in terms of its product complexity and export-import balance. The resulting visualisations bring how industries shift across decades to life. While some advance toward greater complexity and strength, becoming a part of Romaniaâ€™s export landscape, others regress orremain dependent on imports. A second layer of visualisation presents individual chemical products in a series of boxes. Each column traces a sector and maps the destinations of its exports, situating specific trajectories within broader industrial patterns.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-rb9y5w\">More at the \u003Ca href=\"https://faber.ro/en/eveniment/design-signals-chemical-bonds-exhibition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exhibition page\u003C/a> and the \u003Ca href=\"https://thometnanni.github.io/design-signals-interactive/\" rel=\"nofollow\">interactive demo\u003C/a>.\u003C/p> \u003Cimg src=\"/media/faber_4.webp\" style=\"max-width:200px\">"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
