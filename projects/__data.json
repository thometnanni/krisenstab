Using international trade data from 1960 onward, each sectoris represented on a scatter plot graph in terms of its product complexity and export-import balance. The resulting visualisations bring how industries shift across decades to life. While some advance toward greater complexity and strength, becoming a part of Romania’s export landscape, others regress orremain dependent on imports. A second layer of visualisation presents individual chemical products in a series of boxes. Each column traces a sector and maps the destinations of its exports, situating specific trajectories within broader industrial patterns.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-rb9y5w\">More at the \u003Ca href=\"https://faber.ro/en/eveniment/design-signals-chemical-bonds-exhibition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exhibition page\u003C/a> and the \u003Ca href=\"https://thometnanni.github.io/design-signals-interactive/\" rel=\"nofollow\">interactive demo\u003C/a>.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-hyytl5\">   \u003C/p> ",[26,27,28,29],"/media/faber_4.webp","/media/faber_3.jpg","/media/faber_2.jpg","/media/faber_1.jpg",{"slug":31,"title":32,"date":23,"summaryHtml":33,"media":34},"unfolding-the-archive","Unfolding the Archive","\u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1bacpje\">   \u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-k02p63\">Unfolding the Archive: New Dimensions of Access to Born-digital Architecture Collections is a research project conducted by Ania Molenda at Nieuwe Instituut between 2024-2025.
