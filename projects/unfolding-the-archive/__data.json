It explored how affordances of born-digital design records could improve access to contemporary architecture collections in ways that are dynamic and networked, multimodal, and multivocal.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1v3l0qk\">Born-digital architecture archives present unique opportunities to study and interpret the intertwined relationship between built environment, digital cultures, and social change. However, due to technical limitations of the proprietary software, most of their contents remain inaccessible to the public at large, posing limits to both research and discovery.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1anv45r\">In the Dutch National Collection for Architecture and Urban Planning, where this research was conducted, currently as much as 60% of the collection is inaccessible.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1a5haot\">\u003Ca href=\"https://unfolding-the-archive.thometnanni.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">unfolding-the-archive\u003C/a>\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-7yjlsj\">\u003Cimg src=\"/media/unfolding_4.png\" alt=\"Preview 1\">\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1nrualn\">Unfolding the Archive uses select properties of Computer Aided Design (CAD) Drawing (DWG) and Drawing Interchange Format (DXF) as a dominant CAD file formats found in architecture practice from their introduction in the early 1980s throughout the 2000s.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1d18sow\">It proposes new conceptual approaches to access archives including CAD archival records based on their embedded metadata. By doing so it allows the users to form a better understanding of born digital archives as data, not a collection of individual files. It allows to understand the relationships between archival objects and better contextualise archives, providing insights into the structure and unique characteristics of individual collections, that are impossible to see with a naked eye and without specialist technical knowledge.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1nxe6kx\">On the most direct level it aims to stimulate users to engage with born digital collections on the level of relations and help them to identify research questions prior to requesting files. It also hopes for creating new insights that would otherwise only be available to researchers with highly technical knowledge or significant funding and through that contribute to democratisation of research with born digital architecture collections, making them more multivocal.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1sayvlm\">\u003Cimg src=\"/media/unfolding_2.png\" alt=\"Preview 2\">\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-4bfg9d\">Drawing from the concept of generous interfaces, the three prototypes developed within this project aim to open ways for researchers to study the history of contemporary design practices and their social implications in ways that go beyond the structure of the catalogue.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-3h44j7\">Through a multimodal approach, each prototype focuses on a distinct digital property: the creation date, the file layer structure, and the geometry information. These different modes were selected to test if they can enable different readings supported by different forms of data visualisation.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1goqccm\">This first collection of prototypes, which undeniably excludes many aspects due to time and scope of the research, allows to make the complexity, interconnectedness, non-linearity, and collaboration of the design process more visible and open for interpretation.\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-17hnx6f\">\u003Cimg src=\"/media/unfolding_5.png\" alt=\"Preview 4\">\u003C/p> \u003Cp data-svelte-h=\"svelte-gdufmn\">The project has been supported by NWO Museum Grant in 2023. It was conducted by the Dutch National Collection for Architecture and Urban Planning held by at Nieuwe Instituut by Ania Molenda as the primary investigator and Costas Papadopulos of Maastricht University as academic supervisor.\u003C/p>",{"title":3,"image":7,"url":8},"http://sveltekit-prerender/media/unfolding_1.png","http://sveltekit-prerender/projects/unfolding-the-archive/"],"uses":{"params":["slug"],"url":1}}]}
